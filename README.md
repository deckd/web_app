# Deckd App

- A tool for quickly posting info for a group, such as at an event, when you need to share info about wifi, hashtags, etc.
- Content is persisted locally only (ie nothing is saved to a database on a server), meaning no security or privacy concerns.
- Clear content with a (reset) "trash" button.
- Try it out at [deckd.co](http://deckd.co).

## Roadmap

- Markup support
- Footer with app info
- UI tweaks: clear deck confirmation, hide clear button unless slide has content.
