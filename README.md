# Deckd App

- A tool for quickly posting info for a group, such as at an event, when you need to share info about wifi, hashtags, etc.
- Content is persisted locally only, so no need for authentication.
- Use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for basic formatting.
- Clear content with a (reset) "trash" button.
- Try it out at [deckd.co](http://deckd.co).
